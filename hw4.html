        <h4>Part 1a:</h4> Create a webpage that contains a script, using the for statement, 
        that calculates the product and sum of every fourth integer from 5 to 25 inclusive and then 
        displays the results, along with some accompanying text.
        <br>
        (Note: You should print a line that contains the result of 5 * 9 * 13 * 17 * 21 * 25 and a 
        second line that contains the result of 5 + 9 + 13 + 17 + 21 + 25). 
        <br>
        
        <h4>Part 1b:</h4>  On the same webpage as Part 1a, create a script, using the while or do 
        while statement, that calculates the product and sum of every third integer from 3 to 18 
        inclusive an then displays the results, along with some accompanying text.
        (Note: You should print a line that contains the result of 3 * 6 * 9 * 12 * 15 * 18 and 
        a second line that contains the result of 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18).
        <br>
        Make sure you use toLocaleString() to present the result with the correct punctuation
        - it is horrible for users to read a big number such as 1342658 instead of reading as 
        1,342,658 that shows the separation of the thousands.

        Create a webpage that contains a script that will calculate compound interest on a 
        principal of $1000 for interest rates of 5, 6, and 7%, for years 1 through 10. 
        The formula to use is : A = P(1 + r)n where
<br>
P is the principal (the initial amount you borrow or deposit) 
<br>
r is the annual rate of interest (percentage)
<br>
n is the number of years the amount is deposited
<br>
A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest
<br>
Output in table format the year followed by the total amount calculated for each of the 
interest rates of 5% - 7%. (Be sure to include decimals for the cents.) 
Your 3rd column should contain the corresponding interest rate.
There is NO INPUT for this problem as well! The 3 tables (one for 5%, another for 6% and 
another for 7%) should be shown as soon as the page is opened (loaded in the browser).

        Create a webpage that contains a script that reads in the size of the side of a square
         and displays a hollow square of that size constructed of asterisks. Your script should
          work for squares only for side sizes between 2 and 10 inclusive. Display an error 
          message if the user enters any number that is not between 2 and 10 and, of course, 
          DO NOT PRESENT THE SQUARE. Be sure that the output looks like a square. A common 
          error is having the top and bottom row of asterisks appear to be smaller than the 
          sides. [Hint: use nested while or for statements and use a monospaced CSS style for 
          the output.]
        <br>
        Note: There should be NO ASTERISKS (*) inside the square - it should be a hollow square 
        like the image below (notice that there is a space between each * printed asterisk at 
        the top and the bottom of the square which you do not need to provide when printing the 
        asterisks of the side of the square as the browser already provides a space between 
        each line):
