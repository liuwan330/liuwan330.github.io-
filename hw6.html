    Create a webpage that contains a script that has  a function that uses Math.round, 
    Math.sqrt, Math.floor, toFixed() etc. to obtain the following:
    <br>
    a) round the floating-point number to the nearest integer
    <br>
    b) calculate the square root of the floating-point number and round it to an integer
    <br>
    c) round the floating-point number to the nearest tenths position
    <br>
    d) round the floating-point number to the nearest hundredths position
    <br>
    e) round the floating-point number to the nearest thousandths position
    <br>

    <div id="demo2" class="collapse">
        Create a webpage that contains a script using a form that allows the user to input 
        several lines of text and a search character and uses the String method charAt to 
        determine the number of occurrences of the search character within the text. 
        Use a form textarea for the text and a form input box for the search character.
        <br>
        If the search character is found within the text, display the number of occurrences of 
        the search character in another input box or a textarea (of course, those should be disabled 
        for users to type anything).
        <br>
        If the search character is not found within the text then display within a new window 
        (using the window.open() method), the message, 'Search character not found in text string!' 
        along with the search character - make sure that the output input box (or textarea) would be 
        cleared if that error message is showing, meaning it would not show any previous result.
        <br>
        Your new window should be a width of 300 pixels, height of 100 pixels, and should not obscure 
        any of the main content already on the page.Remember that it does not matter if the user
        types a lowercase letter to search - the match should be done and accepted if the text 
        contains the same letter either in lowercase or uppercase - <strong> letter "t" would be found twice in
        this text "This time"!</strong>
