Create a webpage in which users are allowed to select a page layout and formatting through 
the use of the className property. Choose at least three form elements such as: radio buttons, 
select items, checkboxes, and buttons to allow the user to change some CSS property of the 
page - for example: a group of radio buttons for the user to select background color, a select 
item for the user to select font size or group of font family, a group of checkboxes where the 
user can select italic (font style), bold (font weight), etc.
<br>
Attention! Remember that certain styles cannot be applied at the same time! For example, it is 
not possible to offer a group of checkboxes for the user to select different font-sizes as you 
will not be able to apply all the choices the user can make with a group of checkboxes 
(in a group of checkboxes the user can select more than one option, right?). So, for this type 
of style, you could use a group of radio buttons (in a group of radio buttons, the user can 
only select one option, right?)
<br>
You should not ignore any of the choices made by the user which means that once a choice is 
made, it should remain active on the page or the area selected to apply the changes. 
The choice should be applied when the choice is made! For example, if you give radio buttons 
for the background color, such as: cyan, light green, or orange and the user chooses orange, 
the orange background should be applied immediately! Then, after that choice, if in another 
option you give checkboxes for the user to choose font bold, and/or font italic and the user 
selects both checkboxes, then the page should maintain the background color chosen from the 
radio button and apply the new styles (bold font and italicized font) as well, etc. 
<br>
In case of checkboxes, if the user uncheck the mark of a checkbox, the style that was unchecked 
should be removed from the page or area selected!

        Create a webpage that contains a script using a form that allows the user to input 
        several lines of text and a search character and uses the String method charAt to 
        determine the number of occurrences of the search character within the text. 
        Use a form textarea for the text and a form input box for the search character.
        <br>
        If the search character is found within the text, display the number of occurrences 
        of the search character in another input box or a textarea (of course, those should be 
        disabled for users to type anything).  
        <br>
        If the search character is not found within the text then display within a new window 
        (using the window.open() method), the message, 'Search character not found in text 
        string!' along with the search character - make sure that the output input box 
        (or textarea) would be cleared if that error message is showing, meaning it would not 
        show any previous result.  
        <br>
        Your new window should be a width of 300 pixels, height of 100 pixels, and should not 
        obscure any of the main content already on the page. 
        <br>
        Remember that it does not matter if the user types a lowercase letter to search - 
        the match should be done and accepted if the text contains the same letter either in 
        lowercase or uppercase - letter "t" would be found twice in this text "This time"!
